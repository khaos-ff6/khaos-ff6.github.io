        </div>



		<div id="2." class="chapterHeading">2. Introduction &ndash; The Purpose of the "Abbreviated" Guide</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		In keeping with the purpose of this guide, I'll get straight to the point and
		describe... the purpose of this guide: to provide you what you want to know,
		when you want to know it as you play through FFVI, as succinctly as possible.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		If you are looking for a guide that tells you in complete, tedious detail the
		entire sequence of buttons to press on the gamepad to get you from the opening
		sequence to the final credits, then look elsewhere; I'm not going to hold your
		hand and play the game for you.  If there is a room in a dungeon with a simple
		treasure chest smack in the middle, no strings attached, I am not going to
		waste space telling you to open it; it should be a no-brainer.  I'm also not
		going to give you a complete item listing, bestiary, skill guide, etc.  There
		are already plenty of in-depth guides on these things out there that do a far
		better job than I could.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		This guide is intended for people who want to experience the best the game has
		to offer, but don't want to do so at the cost of hours upon hours of scanning
		through multiple FAQs trying to root out the useful information from the wordy
		blatherings.  (I know, this intro is kind of a wordy blathering itself; I
		promise it's the only part of this guide that will be.)  SO, here is what I
		WILL do.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		If there's a totally sweet item that's easy to miss, I'll tell you about it so
		that you don't miss it.  If there's an amusing cutscene that most people
		wouldn't normally catch, I'll make sure you have the opportunity to see it.  If
		there's an incredibly powerful, useful, or interesting strategy or game
		mechanic that isn't obvious, I'll explain it to you.  And best of all, this
		information is ordered in the guide according to the order of the game; you
		won't have to Ctrl + F to death to find all of the relevant information for
		the point you are at.  The only exception to this is the information that I
		feel is important to know upfront, which I have placed... upfront.  Finally,
		any information that I think you'll likely want to keep referring back to has
		been placed in a quick reference section that you can print off or keep up in
		its own dedicated browser tab or window.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		So without further ado, let's play Final Fantasy VI...
		</div>



		<div id="3." class="chapterHeading">3. Important Info to Know Upfront</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		Ok, I lied, there's a little bit more ado.  Still, this is important
		information that I think is valuable to have before you begin the game.
		PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS INFORMATION.  I have tried to avoid repeating it within
		the guide unless absolutely necessary, so it's important that you look over it
		since it might not be mentioned again.
		</div>
		
		
		
		<div class="htmlOnly" style="margin-top: 40px;">
		<div id="3.0." class="htmlSectionHeading">3.0. The HTML Version</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		Welcome to the special HTML version of The Abbreviated Guide to Final Fantasy
		VI.  This version utilizes CSS, Javascript, and cookies to provide you with
		some extra conveniences not possible in the typical, straight-text GameFAQs
		guide.  Here are the extra features available to you:
		</div>
		
		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		When you exit the guide by leaving the page or closing your browser, the guide
		saves your position so that the next time you open it you'll start right where
		you left off.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		The table of contents is expandible (hover over the top left) and allows you to
		quickly and easily jump to any part of the guide simply by clicking on its name
		in the contents.  It also now includes an alphabetized list of items you can
		win under the Colosseum section.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		References within the guide to other sections of the guide now provide "tangent
		links" to those sections that appear as green text with a dotted underline.
		When you click on a tangent link, your current position in the guide is saved
		and can be returned to by clicking the Return button that appears in the bottom
		left.  Clicking on multiple tangent links in succession saves all previous
		positions, and so likewise clicking Return multiple times will cycle back
		through them.  Like your current position in the guide, your tangent position
		history is saved across browser sessions.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		Tangent links are intended to be used for deviating from, and then returning to,
		the normal flow of the guide.  Links in the table of contents are not
		considered "tangents", but are instead intended to be a way to jump around the
		guide "permanently".  To reflect this purpose, clicking on a link in the table
		of contents clears your tangent link position history.  I tried having ALL
		links be tangent links, but I noticed it quickly became disorienting; since you
		can use the table of contents regardless of what your current position is in
		the guide, returning to that position often gives you no logical point of
		reference to help you remember where you left off or why you deviated from that
		position to begin with.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Throughout the guide there are special features to help you keep track of your
		progress in various aspects of the game over time (i.e. which monster
		formations you have encountered, which Rages you have collected, etc.), or just
		simply provide some other sort of extra convenience.  These tools can be added
		to a special area on the right (which I like to call the "cookie jar") by
		clicking on the purple, dotted underline links that correspond with them.  If
		you no longer need a tool and want to remove it from the cookie jar, double
		click its label in the jar.
		</div>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		The first one of these tools is a <div class="jarAddLink" onclick="enableRefTangents();">Reference Tangents</div>
		section: a set of tangent links to parts of the reference section so that you
		can easily jump to and return from this frequently-needed information any time
		you wish.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Most special content within the guide that is specific to the HTML version is
		enclosed in a box just like this one.
		</div></li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="bodyText">
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">TAKE NOTE:</span> The position values saved for loading or returning to
		previous positions are dependent on the size of your browser window.  In order
		to return to the correct position, your window needs to be the same size it was
		when the position was saved.  For this reason, I recommend always viewing the
		guide with your browser maximized so that your browser window size remains
		consistent.
		</div>
		</div>



		<div id="3.1." class="sectionHeading">3.1. About the Walkthrough</div>
		
		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		This guide is primarily geared towards those who have played Final Fantasy VI
		before.  I have tried to include a little direction for the first-time
		player, but I won't be elaborating on basic Final Fantasy info (i.e.
		characters with the Float status can't be hit by earth elemental attacks such
		as Quake).
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		The best way to use the guide is to read each section just before you play
		through it and then leave it open to refer back to as you play.  This way you
		shouldn't miss anything important, but also shouldn't have to spend more than
		a few minutes in the guide for each section.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		READ THE GUIDE IN ORDER.  In each section, I will be assuming that you have
		read the previous sections.  This is the best way I know to minmize
		excessive redundancy and make the guide flow linearly, as is my intent.  I
		will occasionaly refer back to previously mentioned information, but most of
		the time I will assume that you remember the important things.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		For the purposes of this guide, the term "cutscene" refers to any dialogue or
		scene where you lose control of the game (other than pressing the button for
		dialogue continuation) and simply witness the characters interacting.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If I don't fully explain something important or interesting right away, just
		trust me; it will be explained when necessary.  If I still don't, then skip
		to the bottom where the contact information is and let me know!
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Throughout the walkthrough I will refer to two main sections/areas of the
		game: the World of Balance (WoB), and the World of Ruin (WoR).  If you don't
		already know what these are, then suffice it to say that you start the game
		in the WoB, and you'll know when you get to the WoR without my having to tell
		you.
		</div></li>
		</ul>
		


		<div id="3.2." class="sectionHeading">3.2. About Game Mechanics</div>


		<div id="3.2.1." class="subsectionHeading">3.2.1. Useful but Non-Obvious Basics</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Experience points earned from battles are evenly divided among the party
		members alive at the end, however the number of points earned that the game
		displays for you is actually the number each living character receives after
		the division of the total.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you "double click" on a piece of equipment in the Items menu, you can view
		detailed information about what bonuses and special properties it has.  This
		becomes especially useful in the latter half of the game where items with
		many special qualities become much more common.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you want to get a quick overview of what all the characters in your party
		have equipped (including relics), go to the menu, select Equip, and then hit
		Left on the D-pad.  This should allow you to select everyone at once.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Characters can be in either the front or back row for purposes of battle.
		Characters in the back row take half damage from basic physical attacks, but
		also do half damage with normal Fight attacks (unless they are equiped with a
		special weapon that does full damage from the back row).  To change what row
		a character starts the battle in, go to the menu, press left, and "double
		click" on the character's portrait to toggle between rows.
		</div></li>
		</ul>


		<div id="3.2.2." class="subsectionHeading">3.2.2. Character Stats</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		The statistics every character in the game has are as follows:
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		<div class="infoLine"><div class="dotUnderline">Stats gained on level up:</div></div>
		<table>
		<tr><td>Vigor</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines physical damage output in a smaller part</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Speed</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines time between turns in battle</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Stamina</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines hit rate of instant death attacks against the character</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Mag.Pwr</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">(Magic Power) Determines damage and curative output of spells</td></tr>
		</table>
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		<div class="infoLine"><div class="dotUnderline">Stats improved through equipment:</div></div>
		<table>
		<tr><td>Bat.Pw</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">(Battle Power) Determines physical damage output in a larger part</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Defense</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines physical damage taken</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Evade</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines absolutely nothing (except in the GBA version; see below)</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Mag.Def</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">(Magic Defense) Determines magic damage taken</td></tr>
		<tr><td>MBlock</td><td class="rightCell">-</td><td class="rightCell">Determines chance to avoid ANY attack that is not unblockable</td></tr>
		</table>
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		In the SNES and PSX versions of the game, the Evade stat is bugged and does
		nothing.  This causes the Blind status to do nothing, and it also renders the
		Goggles (prevents Blind) and Beads (halves attacker's hit rate) relics
		totally worthless.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		So how can you dodge physical attacks?  Well, as it turns out, the bug also
		causes the MBlock stat to be used for dodging any attack in the game that
		isn't unblockable, be it physical or magical.  So, pay attention to equipment
		that adds to MBlock.  Having an MBlock of 128 or higher will guarantee that
		if an attack is blockable, the character will block it every time.
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Also worth noting is the fact that if a character has 255 Defense, they will
		receive 1 damage if in the front row and 0 damage if in the back row when hit
		with a physical attack.  Thanks mostly to an outstanding piece of armor
		called the Snow Muffler, Gau and Mog can reach 255 Defense at fairly low
		levels (they are the only two that can wear it).
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		There are spells, special abilities, and weapons that "ignore defense".  This
		means that they are inhibited neither by the target's Defense nor Magic
		Defense.
		</div></li>
		</ul>


		<div id="3.2.3." class="subsectionHeading">3.2.3. Spells, Elements, and Statuses</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		When I state that a spell or ability "divides damage", all I mean is that it
		does more damage to a single target than it does to each of several targets.
		I don't think it's as simple as a literal division of the single-target total
		by the number of targets, but I could be wrong.  The important thing is that
		it is more/less in single/multi-target situations.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Note that "Poison" can refer to either the status effect or the type of
		elemental damage.  In the guide I will indicate which with [E] for elemental
		damage type and [S] for status effect.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you're not a veteran Final Fantasy player, it's worth noting how the
		Reflect status works.  Characters with Reflect will have all spells cast on
		them bounced back to their opponent(s) instead.  However, Reflect can only
		bounce a spell once, so if your opponent has Reflect, just grant one of your
		party members Reflect as well and then bounce any offensive spells off of
		that party member.  Keep in mind that Reflect bounces curative magic as well,
		though.  There are a few offensive and defensive spells and special abilities
		that aren't affected by Reflect; the important ones will be noted when you
		come across them.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		One non-obvious status effect in the game is the Seizure status.  A character
		or enemy with this status will lose HP over time, just like with the Poison
		status, however there's no visual cue to tell you the character has this
		status.  Seizure is the functional opposite of the Regen spell/status, so
		casting Regen on a character will remove Seizure from him/her.  However, it
		can also be cured via the Remedy spell or item, or the Antdot spell.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		When a character or enemy "absorbs" an element, all damage of that element
		will heal instead of harm him/her/it.  When an attack or spell consists of
		multiple elements, characters or enemies that absorb just one of them will
		absorb the entire attack.  Likewise, characters or enemies that are weak to
		just one of them and are neutral to the others (take normal damage from them)
		will be weak to the entire attack.  Absorbtion trumps weakness for multi-
		element attacks.
		</div></li>
		</ul>


		<div id="3.2.4." class="subsectionHeading">3.2.4. The Steal Command</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Since the Steal command becomes available to you quite early on, I'll do a
		bit of explaining about it here.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Enemies in the game can have a rare Stealable item, common Stealable item,
		both, or none.  "Rare" and "common" refer to the chance of receiving the item
		upon a successful Steal attempt, not the general availability of the item in
		the game.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		If an enemy only has either a rare or a common steal (not both), then you can
		repeatedly attempt to steal until you successfully get it, provided both you
		and the enemy survive long enough.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		If an enemy has a rare and a common steal both, which one receive on a
		successful Steal attempt is chosen at random, and once you have stolen one of
		them, the other becomes unavailable to subsequent Steal attempts on the same
		target.  So for example if you know an enemy has a rare Steal and a common
		Steal, and you successfully Steal the common item, you won't be able to then
		Steal the rare one from the same enemy in the same encounter.  Keep this in
		mind when reading the Steal info in the guide, especially for boss encounters.
		If you know a boss has both a rare and a common Steal, and you know you want
		the rare one badly, save your game before the fight and be prepared to load
		and try again several times.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Spells (Dischord) or relics (Sneak Ring) that increase the chance of success
		for Steal do not affect the chance of getting the rare Steal versus the
		common one.  So they help you succeed at Stealing more frequently, but do not
		help you acquire the rare item more frequently than the common item.
		</div></li>
		</ul>


		<div id="3.2.5." class="subsectionHeading">3.2.5. Veldt Mechanics</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		One of the characters you'll recruit in the game has the ability to assume
		some of the attacks and properties of monsters you encounter throughout the
		game using a skill called Rage, which he has in place of the Fight command
		(more about this in the Key Stategies section below).  Rages must be
		collected in an area of the world map called the Veldt, where you can
		encounter any formation of enemies that you have encountered elsewhere in the
		game (a "formation" being a set of specific enemies found in a single
		encounter).  Only formations you have already encountered in other parts of
		the game will appear on the Veldt.  It is not necessary to win a battle for
		the formation encountered to become available on the Veldt, you only need to
		leave it without having been totally defeated (or "Annihilated", as the game
		so delicately puts it).
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Each time you encounter a formation on the Veldt, rather than picking it
		randomly from all those available, the game instead cylces in order through a
		set list of groups (commonly referred to by fans as "packs") consisting of up
		to 8 formations, one of which is chosen at random.  If the next pack in the
		sequence is empty or you haven't yet encountered any of the formations in it,
		the game moves on to choose a formation from the subsequent pack.
		(See <div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('6.4.');">6.4. Veldt Packs</div> in the Quick Reference section for the pack listing.)
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I mention this mechanic because depending on what version of the game you are
		playing, there are a couple of ways to manipulate the next pack chosen to
		your advantage when trying to get Rages from specific formations:
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			In the SNES version, the game jumps ahead 13 packs when you load a saved
			game.  So if you would normally encounter a formation from pack 15 on
			your next encounter, you can save and load your game so that instead you
			will encounter a formation from pack 28.  This allows you to jump past
			packs that don't contain any formations you are interested in and more
			quickly cycle back around to those that do until you have collected the
			Rages you want.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			In the PSX version, normally when you load a saved game your next pack is
			randomized.  However, if you allow your party to be defeated, the game
			automatically loads your last saved game with the same next pack number
			you had at the time you created the save.  This works in the SNES version
			as well.  The game also loads in the data used to (pseudo)randomly
			determine the next formation, so the formation chosen from the pack will
			also always be the same.  This has its uses, but isn't very desirable for
			Rage hunting.
			</div>
			
			<div class="bodyText">
			However, you can force the game to choose a different formation from the
			same pack by leaving the Veldt and fighting a battle elsewhere (making
			this method of manipulation only feasible if you have an airship).  So to
			keep retrying the same pack:
			</div>

				<ul class="bulletIndent">
				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Fight until you know that the pack you want is up next.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Save your game.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Try to get the formation you want.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				If you don't get it, fight another battle and intentionally die.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				After the auto-load, go fight a battle elsewhere (I recommend
				alternating between Figaro Cave and the Phantom Forest in the WoB,
				and Figaro Cave and Narshe in the WoR); this should change the data
				used to pseudo-randomly select the next formation (note that this
				might not always mean a different formation is chosen).
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Save again so you don't have to start over from the original save
				data if you fail to get what you want again.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Try again to get the formation you want.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				If you still don't get it, repeat the process until you do, making
				certain to never fight the not-on-the-Veldt battle in the same
				location twice in a row; I'm not 100% certain, but it seemed that in
				my tests fighting the off-Veldt battle would fail to change the
				formation-determining data if I used the same location as the
				previous off-Veldt battle.
				</div>

					<ul class="bulletIndent">
					<li><div class="bodyText">
					Occasionally, I have run into a situation where the off-Veldt
					battle seems to fail to alter the formation-determining data even
					when dutifully alternating locations.  When this happens,
					fighting several battles in multiple locations before trying the
					Veldt again seems to solve the issue (i.e. fighting 2 or 3
					battles in one location, 2 or 3 in another, and 2 or 3 back in
					the first one or in a third one).
					</div></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="bodyText">
			It's not exactly a piece of cake, but it does give you some measure of
			control versus just cycling through the packs over and over and over.

		<div id="3.3." class="sectionHeading">3.3. About Key Strategies</div>


		<div id="3.3.1." class="subsectionHeading">3.3.1. Colosseum Strategy</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		(WARNING: If you are a first-time FFVI player, parts of the following won't
		make much sense to you, but I recommend you read it anyway.  It will make
		sense later when you get to the area of the game I'm referring to.)
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		In the latter half of the game, there is a place called the Colosseum at
		which you can bet items to win better (or sometimes just different) items in
		exchange.  Each time you bet an item, you must choose a character from your
		party to compete in a fight with a single enemy.  What item you bet
		determines what enemy you will face and what item you will win if you
		survive the fight (the same item bet always yields the same enemy and the
		same item to win).  Win or lose the battle, you always lose the item you bet.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		The most important aspect of Colosseum battles and the reason I mention them
		upfront is the fact that the actions of your character are chosen for you at
		random from among the attacks, skills, and spells available to him/her.
		Usually all you can do is equip the character for the battle as best you can
		and cross your fingers.  However, I have developed a Colosseum strategy that
		works astoundingly well, but must be kept in mind from the very beginning of
		the game.  I'm probably not the first to suggest this method, but I did
		contrive it independent of outside input and have yet to see it anywhere else.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		It's really a beautifully simple strategy.  Mog is the ultimate Colosseum
		character, IF before you are done with the Colosseum:
		</div>

			<ul class="condenseList" style="padding-left: 30px;">
			<li class="condenseListItem">
			You don't use his team in battle when defending Terra at the beginning of
			the game,
			</li>
			<li class="condenseListItem">
			You don't recruit him OR don't use him in battle in the WoB, and
			</li>
			<li class="condenseListItem">
			You don't teach him any magic.
			</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="bodyText">
		This will ensure that when you get to the WoR and recruit him, he will only
		have the Fight command available to use in the Colosseum.  Most battles in
		the game will cause him to learn a Dance based on the setting of the battle,
		hence the need to keep him out of battle entirely; even if he is dead or you
		managed to get only him to run away, he will still learn the Dance if you
		complete the battle.  Once he learns a Dance he pretty much goes from best to
		worst Colosseum character, given that once a Dance is used, it continues for
		all of Mog's turns for the rest of the battle.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		It's possible to achieve this Fight-only state with at least one other
		character I know of (Shadow), but what makes Mog so special is his ability to
		equip spear/lance type weapons.  These weapons do 2x normal damage when used
		with the Jump command, which is granted by the DragoonBoots relic. Jump
		causes the character to leap into the air for a time, during which he is
		invulnerable to attack, and then drop back down and attack (for 1.5x normal
		damage with any non-spear/lance weapon).  Even better, you can additionally
		equip the Dragon Horn relic, which causes the attack from each Jump to hit
		two to four times instead of just once.  Plus as previously mentioned (see
		<div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('3.2.2.');">3.2.2. Character Stats</div>), Mog is one of two charaters that can use the awesome
		Snow Muffler armor to achieve the maximum of 255 Defense early on.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		With only the Fight and Jump commands available for him to use, Mog doesn't
		ever have a wasted move in the Colosseum (i.e. casting Cure on himself on the
		first round when he is undamaged, etc.).  If you follow the walkthrough for
		the WoR in the order I have written it, you will be able to easily win nearly
		every worthwhile item from the Colosseum in a single visit pretty early,
		using Mog almost exclusively.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		(FFVI veterans may be saying to themselves, "Wait a minute, he said Mog will
		have BOTH Fight and Jump available, but Jump clearly replaces the Fight
		command", and they would be correct, if this weren't the Colosseum.
		Unfortunately, characters retain the ability to perform a basic Fight attack
		in the Colosseum when Jump is added to their reportoire via DragoonBoots.)
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I have found that this Colosseum strategy is so effective that I will be
		assuming its use in the walkthrough.  This shouldn't inconvenience you too
		much if you don't wish to follow it; simply ignore my periodic advice related
		to it (i.e. not using Mog's party when defending Terra).
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I also recommend that you don't teach Shadow ANY spells until you are done
		with Colosseum bets because, as mentioned earlier, he also can be used as a
		Fight-command-only character in the Colosseum (due to the fact that Throw is
		not available in Colosseum battles).  After the main Colosseum trip with Mog
		as the star of the show, you will very likely want to use him in battle, so
		Shadow is a great backup character to use for any future bets once you've
		ruined Mog with Dances.  Keeping Shadow magic free allows you to take
		advantage of a strategy that makes him as-good if not better than Mog for
		Colosseum battles, but that does not become available until late in the game.
		It will be mentioned when you get to it in the guide, or you can jump to
		<div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('4.2.50.')">4.2.50. Collecting the Imp Gear</div> if you are curious about it now.
		</div></li>
		</ul>


		<div id="3.3.2." class="subsectionHeading">3.3.2. Gau and the Merit Award</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Gau is a unique party member in FFVI in that instead of the Fight command, he
		has a skill called Rage that allows him to adopt the status immunities and
		elemental strengths and weaknesses of most random encounter monsters in the
		game, as well as the ability to use the special skills for those monsters.
		When used in combat, you choose a single monster from a list of those whose
		Rages Gau has acquired, and then for the rest of the battle Gau has a chance
		of either using a physical attack or the special ability of that Rage each
		time he takes a turn.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Normally Gau cannot equip weapons, and to make up for this, his base physical
		attack power is much greater than the other characters in the game.  However,
		there is a relic you can obtain from the Colosseum called the Merit Award
		which allows the equipped character to use quite a few weapons and armors
		he or she would not normally be able to equip.  In the SNES version of FFVI,
		Gau can equip the Merit Award and consequently can equip weapons.  This is
		totally awesome for a few reasons:
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Equipping a weapon adds onto Gau's already unusually high base physical
			damage.  This ends up equalizing a lot of the end-game weapons in that
			many of them cause Gau to hit the Battle Power cap of 255.  This kind of
			sounds like a bad thing, but it means that you are more free to choose
			weapons primarily based on their special properties instead of mainly
			their Battle Power.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Rage special skills that are just basic attacks with a multiplier (the
			best of which is Stray Cat's Catscratch attack at a x4 multiplier) also
			apply the same multiplier to the spells from chance-to-cast-on-hit
			weapons if they are triggered by the attack (note that the pre-multiplier
			amount will be based on the character's Mag.Pwr rather than Vigor).  A
			favorite for this is Cyan's Tempest weapon, since the Wind Slash spell it
			sometimes casts hits all monsters instead of one, but it is effective for
			any such weapons.  Equipping weapons with elemental properties is also
			very effective with Catscratch when hitting monsters weak to the element.
			Even better, if Gau is equipped with the Offering relic, its effect
			applies to Catscratch attacks, meaning they occur four times instead of
			one (I think still at half power as is normal for Offering, but who cares
			when Catscratch itself is 4x more powerful than a basic attack?).
			</div></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Unfortunately, Square apparently did not intend for Gau to be able to equip
		weapons via the Merit Award, because in the PSX and GBA versions of the game,
		they made Gau unable to equip it.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		More about Gau and his uses (Merit Award or no) can be found in the
		walkthrough when you acquire him.  However, I should warn you that I have
		kept my recommended Rages to the bare minimum in this guide, since collecting
		any significant number of Rages can take a very, very long time, and most of
		them grant abilities the same as or comparable to spells that Gau can learn
		and use 100% of the time rather than by chance (although they cost MP, unlike
		Rage abilities).  If you are interested in investing the time necessary to
		collect a wider variety of potentially useful Rages (or if you are a
		masochist and want to collect ALL the Rages), I suggest both Djibriel's and
		Skoobouy's Rage guides found on GameFAQs.com.

		In the PSX version of the game, you can save a "Memo file", which is just a

		Since this is the first place you'll encounter an enemy with a recommended
		Rage, it's time to start thinking about whether or not you feel Gau is worth
		the time.  (The fact that it's best to make this decision early is why I
		included the <div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('3.2.5.');">3.2.5. Veldt Mechanics</div> section in the upfront info section;
		check it out if you haven't already.)  Even with the Veldt pack trick, you're
		probably looking at a few hours of hunting just to get the very few Rages I
		recommend.  Here's some things to keep in mind:
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Gau can only use the Merit Award in the SNES version, so he's not nearly
			as worthwhile in the other versions as an end-game character.  On the
			other hand, when he can use the Merit Award you're most likely going to
			be using the Stray Cat Rage 99.9% of the time, which isn't hard to get,
			so SNES or no doesn't necessarily have to affect how much time you spend
			collecting Rages.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Gau has some Rages available quite early on with attacks that are much
			more powerful than anything your other characters will be able to do at
			the same point in the game.  Keep in mind that special abilities from
			Rages don't take any MP to cast.  These great early Rages are:
			</div>

				<ul class="bulletIndent">
				<li><div class="bodyText">
				ChickenLip.  The ChickenLip Rage is available towards the end of the
				WoB, and its special attack is Quake.  Quake is very powerful and
				hits both friend and foe, so when all your party members are equipped
				with the Gaia Gear armor (which grants absorbtion of Earth elemental
				damage), you can do massive damage and massive healing at the same
				time.
				</div></li>

				<li><div class="bodyText">
				Anguiform and Aspik.  Anguiform and Aspik become available at the
				same time, not long after you acquire Gau.  However, to collect them
				as soon as they are available requires an optional return trip to the
				Veldt.  The Anguiform Rage grants the Aqua Rake attack, which hits
				all enemies for slightly more damage than a second level spell and is
				both Water and Air elemental (when I talk about spell "level", I'm
				referring to the Fire, Fire 2, Fire 3 type spell power tiers; at this
				point you've probably only seen Terra's first level "Fire").  The
				Aspik Rage grants Giga Volt, which randomly targets a single enemy or
				all enemies and is a Lightning elemental attack nearly as powerful as
				Bolt 3.  Both of these attacks bypass the Reflect status.
				</div></li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			While there are many late-game Rages that provide Gau with most of the
			more powerful spells in the game, most of these spells can be taught to
			him and could be used by choice rather than by chance.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			There are some late-game Rages that grant Gau some very interesting
			special abilities that can't be learned as spells which I have not
			included in my recommended Rages (i.e. Gilomantis's Shrapnel attack).  If
			you are more inclined to spend time hunting Rages than I am, it's worth
			looking into these.

		<div id="4.1.27." class="sectionHeading">4.1.27. About Magicite</div>

		<ul>
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		I will normally use the term "Espers" to refer to your equipable Magicite,
		and I will refer to the special "magic points" you earn from battle for
		learning spells as "MXP", in order to easily distinguish between these magic
		points and the magic points (MP) used to cast spells.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Pay attention to the stat bonuses on the Espers.  These are permanently added
		each time the equipped character levels up in addition to whatever stat gains
		they would normally get from leveling.  Vigor and MagPwr are the two most
		worthwhile bonuses, and which is best depends on the character and how you
		play him/her.  If you use mostly magic damage attacks with a character (i.e.
		Blitzes or magic skills from Rages) then go with MagPwr, but if you use
		mostly physical damage attacks (i.e. Chain Saw or physical skills from Rages,
		most notably Catscratch) then go with Vigor.  See <div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('6.2.');">6.2. Esper Stat Bonuses</div> in
		the Quick Reference section for a complete listing of possible bonuses.
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			At this point in the game, I recommend equipping Espers based on what
			stat bonuses they grant rather than what spells they teach (except for
			possibly the curative spells).  You can always run random battles to
			learn spells, and there's a couple of ways to do this without having to
			constantly watch your characters' XP in order to switch them back to the
			Esper with the stat bonus you want when they are about to level up.  I'll
			mention these methods later when they become available.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Note that in the SNES version, the Vigor bonus espers are incorrectly
			labeled as "Strength" bonuses, even though there is no "Strength" stat.

		</li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Also pay attention to what the Espers do when summoned.  Some of them have
		very nice effects, especially those acquired later (i.e. Golem).  To get to
		the summon, select the Magic command in battle and press up while at the top
		of the list of spells the character knows.  Espers can only be summoned once
		per battle.

		You should consider going the route of earning good MXP while at the same
		time earning little or no XP.  Then later, when you are fighting battles that
		give you normal amounts of XP, you can just equip Espers according to their
		stat bonuses without worrying about what spells they teach.  I know of three
		good ways to do this:
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Fight random battles in the first two areas of the Phantom Forest (when
			you enter from the north).  You will encounter either a single Ghost
			worth 3 MXP or a Ghost and two Popliums together for 1 MXP (no, I'm not
			sure how this makes sense).  The Ghost is the more common encounter.
			These battles are worth very little XP, and all of your characters should
			be able to one-shot the enemies here, even from the back row.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Hunt for Intangirs on Triangle Island.  You will encounter a single
			Intangir roughly half of the time here.  Intangirs are worth a whopping
			10 MXP and no XP, but The downside is that the other monsters you'll
			encounter here aren't worth *any* MXP (they are also worth very little
			XP).

			Intangir is normally a very tough monster.  However, it is susceptible to
			instant death attacks; the Rhodox Rage is the best way to kill it since
			it will counter the Doom spell with Meteo on the caster, but won't
			counter Snare.  Meteo hurts.  Use Gau + Rhodox Rage.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Fight on the Veldt.  An encounter on the Veldt gives you just as much MXP
			as it does in its original area, even though it doesn't give you any XP.
			Since some encounters aren't worth any MXP normally, this of course means
			that the same encounters aren't worth any MXP on the Veldt either.  This
			really isn't the best method unless you are killing two or three birds
			with one stone by hunting Rages and/or Lores at the same time.
			</div></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I prefer the Phantom Forest method as I feel it gives you the best MP over
		time.  Intangir is great, until you get unlucky and have a streak of ten non-
		Intangir, 0 MXP encounters in a row.  You also pretty much have to use Gau at
		all times when hunting Intangirs, since trying to survive or revive after
		every Meteo counter attack to Doom is just not worth the trouble. This slows
		you down if you are teaching magic to all of the characters since you can
		only be teaching three of them + Gau at a time.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		Now is a good time to pick up the highly useful Dischord Lore.  Enemies
		immune to instant death attacks are also immune to Dischord.  However, there
		is a bug in the game you can exploit to hit them with it anyway.  The way the
		Vanish status is coded, any enemy that has it can be hit by any spell,
		regardless of whether or not it is one to which they would normally be immune.
		Casting Vanish on a monster immune to instant death then allows you to hit it
		with Dischord.  Because said monster could alse be hit with instant death
		attacks if under the effects of Vanish, this bug can be seriously exploited
		throughout the game.  I strongly recommend against this; it will suck the fun
		right out of the game.  However, exploiting it with Dischord in order to
		Steal items more easily shouldn't ruin your fun at all, unless you LIKE
		spending unnecessarily larger amounts of time trying to Steal stuff...
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you don't already have some, buy some Bolt Edges and Fire Skeans in

		Earrings boost their damage, and that Earrings stack (or Earrings + Hero
		Ring).

		The best way to save Cid from dying is to collect both the fast and medium

		The Economizer is one of the most rare and most coveted relics in the game.
		It causes all Magic spells, Lores, and Esper summons to cost a mere 1 MP.
		There are two ways to acquire an Economizer: get it as a rare Steal from a
		rare encounter with Aquila (who unfortunately has a common Steal), or get it
		as a rare drop from a rare encounter with Brachosaur.
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I have discovered what I believe to be the best strategy for obtaining
		Economizers, and it works for both the SNES and the PSX versions of the game.
		It is as follows:
		</div>

			<ul class="bulletIndent">
			<li><div class="bodyText">
			If you haven't already, encounter Aquila in the Phoenix Cave (try to
			Steal from it too, but odds are good you'll just end up with the common
			Phoenix Down).
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Go to the Veldt and use the trick described in the up-front info section
			to get the encounter with Aquila (see <div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('3.2.5.');">3.2.5. Veldt Mechanics</div>).  Make
			certain you save your game just before the encounter from <div class="tangentLink" onclick="gotoTangent('pack43');">pack 43</div> each
			time until you run into Aquila.  Also, make certain you stick close to
			the airship when you are repeatedly saving during the randomization
			process; if you save on the Veldt so far away from it that you can't
			reach it before you hit the pack 43 encounter, then you won't be able to
			leave to randomize the encounter and get Aquila's formation.
			</div></li>

			<li><div class="bodyText">
			Try to Steal the Economizer.  If you get the Phoenix Down instead, kill
			yourself (Merton is excellent for this task).  When the game auto-loads
			from your last save, your next encounter on the Veldt will always be the
			Aquila encounter.  Vanish/Dischord is of limited usefulness, as it only
			increases the chance of a successful Steal in general and does NOT
			increase the chance of getting the rare Steal over the common.  Unless
			you are too low level to quickly Steal successfully, don't bother.
			</div></li>
			</ul>

		<div class="bodyText">
		I believe this to be the best method because it allows you to, with a bit of
		work up-front, turn the rare encounter with Aquila into an always encounter.
		So instead of looking at a rare encounter with a rare Steal, or a rare
		encounter with a rare drop as your only methods, you are just dealing with a
		rare Steal that can be repeatedly attempted without too much down time.  That
		said, it still can take over an hour to get the first Aquila Veldt encounter,
		so you're still looking at a potentially significant time investment.  I got
		lucky a couple of times, but I was able to acquire 4 Economizers in about
		5-6 hours total using this method (this includes the time taken to initially
		encounter Aquila in the Phoenix cave).  I would be surprised if any other
		method comes close to this without a lot of luck.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you want to do some level grinding, the Dinosaur Forest located north of
		the Veldt is the best place to do this.  The only three encounters here are
		with one Tyranosaur, two Tyranosaurs (always a pincer attack), and rarely,
		one Brachosaur.  Equip each of your characters with an Exp. Egg for maximum
		effect (don't forget that the XP reported at the end of battle is the un-
		doubled amount).
		</div>

		<div class="bodyText">
		Both monsters are weak against Ice.  If you encounter Brachosaur, don't
		forget about the Quick spell; it's a lifesaver.  If you're looking to Steal
		some Ribbons from it, bring along Strago and Relm so that Strago can use
		Vanish/Dischord on it to lower its level, making it easier for Relm to
		incapacitate it with Control and Locke/Gogo to Steal successfully.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you wish, you can make a final trip to the Colosseum.  If you've used Mog
		in battle and therefore he has learned some Dances, Shadow is your best bet
		provided you followed my advice when it comes to not teaching him spells.
		Two great things you may not have bet for yet are more Genji Armors via
		betting the various "Suit" armors Stealable from monsters in Owzer's Mansion,
		and more Genji Helms via betting the Regal Crown and the Coronet (by this
		point you really shouldn't need Control anymore, so giving up your Coronet is
		no big deal).
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
		If you've done even moderate MXP and XP grinding, you should be able to
		afford plenty of the elemental swords from Albrook for Shadow to Throw.  It's
		also nice to stop by an Item shop and max out on Tinctures for Kefka's Tower,
		just for the convenience of instantly accessible MP recovery outside of
		battle.

		Party #2 will next face the second goddess, Doom.  Doom absorbs Ice and
		Poison[E], is weak against Pearl, and is susceptible to Slow.  If she gets

		you can remove with Dispel.
		</div></li>
		
		<li><div class="bodyText">
